# Codex Tool Mapping

Skills use Claude Code tool names. When you encounter these in a skill, use your platform equivalent:

| Skill references | Codex equivalent |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `Task` tool (dispatch subagent) | `spawn_agent` (see [Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support](#subagent-dispatch-requires-multi-agent-support)) |
| Multiple `Task` calls (parallel) | Multiple `spawn_agent` calls |
| Task returns result | `wait_agent` |
| Task completes automatically | `close_agent` to free slot |
| `TodoWrite` (task tracking) | `update_plan` |
| `Skill` tool (invoke a skill) | Skills load natively — just follow the instructions |
| `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` (files) | Use your native file tools |
| `Bash` (run commands) | Use your native shell tools |

## Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support

Add to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

This enables `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent` for skills like `dispatching-parallel-agents` and `subagent-driven-development`.

Legacy note: Codex builds before `rust-v0.115.0` exposed spawned-agent
waiting as `wait`. Current Codex uses `wait_agent` for spawned agents. The
`wait` name now belongs to code-mode `exec/wait`, which resumes a yielded exec
cell by `cell_id`; it is not the spawned-agent result tool.

## Working Directory and Branches

superpowers-lite does NOT rely on git worktrees — all skills work directly on the current branch. The implementer only `git add`s changes; it does **not** auto-commit / push / open PRs. The user reviews and handles those themselves.

If you find that git write operations (branch / push / PR) are restricted inside the Codex sandbox, you don't need to work around it — just stage the changes and tell the user to perform those steps on their own machine.
